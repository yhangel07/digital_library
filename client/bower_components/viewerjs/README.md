## ViewerJS

ViewerJS combines a number of excellent open source tools that are built on HTML and javascript. ViewerJS was funded initially by [NLnet foundation](http://nlnet.nl) and is developed by [KO GmbH](http://kogmbh.com).

The heavy lifting in ViewerJS is done by these awesome projects:

#### WebODF

WebODF is a JavaScript library created by [KO GmbH](http://kogmbh.com). It was started by Jos van den Oever at KO and is now developed by a growing team including external collaborators. It makes it easy to add Open Document Format (ODF) support to your website and to your mobile or desktop applications. It uses HTML and CSS to display ODF documents.

#### PDF.js

PDF.js is a library created by Andreas Gal and others at Mozilla Labs. It is an HTML5 technology experiment that explores building a faithful and efficient Portable Document Format (PDF) renderer without native code assistance.
